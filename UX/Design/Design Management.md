## Design Management

Design management will consider the design life cycle from generating ideas, design reviews, design systems, and more.

## Key Terminology That Helps Us Segment Our Roadmap
Proactive vs Reactive design features
One of the interesting concepts we brainstormed and learned from our analyst conversations was the difference between being proactive or reactive as a designer. Right now, our design management features focus mostly on reactive design.

Examples of Reactive design work:
* Attaching designs to issues that were already defined by a PM
* Participating in a workflow or UX research
* Responding with a UI fix for a bug

Examples of Proactive design work:
* Thinking ahead and sketching an idea you had in the shower
* Rough wireframes or flow diagrams of a new concept
* Iterating and posting, then evangelizing the change you came up with
* Showing designs to colleagues for feedback before an issue is created

## Designer Workflow Across Tools
will support the flexibility of any design workflow, while featuring a simplified way to share of Design work. It would allow for independent design deadlines or separate milestones from engineering, and empower the Designer to easily track/follow the issue through to production.

## Target Audience and Experience
Design Management is targeted at product designers who collaborate with product managers and software developers.

The minimal user journey provides designers with the ability to upload mockups to an issue, and for point of interest discussions to happen on each image. Over time these mockups can be updated to resolve the discussions. As the mockups are changed, new versions will be created to facilitate iteration.

We have achieved the core workflow for a design persona on a GitLab Issue and are considering how to build additional Design Management features targeted at software developers and product managers to expand our growth.
