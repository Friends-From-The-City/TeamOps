## Figma
Figma
Our primary design tool is Figma. As a product designer or product design manager in the UX department, you will have a Professional Figma license and access to the GitLab team in Figma. You don’t need to do anything on your end, other than accept the invite sent to your GitLab email account during onboarding.
Anyone else in GitLab can access your files when you either share the file URL or invite them directly via email, but we ask that you only give them “can view” permissions. Anyone with “can edit” permissions is considered a paid seat and must have approval. A user with “can view“ permission will still be able to comment on and inspect design files.
GitLab has a public Figma profile where anyone can duplicate or remix files we have published. You can view our profile under the Community tab of the GitLab team section, or navigate to https://www.figma.com/@GitLab.
Do not create additional teams. An editor is billed for each team they are on, and we’ve only allocated resources for one team.

### Access and permissions
Figma has four levels of access, also called Permissions, for Professional teams. Permissions can be set at a team, project, and file level.
* Editors - Only GitLab product designers and product design managers in the UX department are editors. Editors have “can edit” access to projects and files, unless otherwise changed.
* Viewers - Viewers on the GitLab team have “can view” access to any project or file, unless otherwise changed.
* Admins - An admin has access to Team Settings, and the Admin Dashboard, including billing.
* Owners - Anyone who creates a team, project, or file will be the default owner of it.
